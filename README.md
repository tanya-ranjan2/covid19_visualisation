# covid19_visualisation and study its spectrum
R-shiny Dashboard


The World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, as a pandemic on March 11, while the exponential increase in the number of cases was risking to overwhelm health systems around the world.
It has affected many spectrum :
  1. Health
  2. Daily life as Job and Business
  3. Global temperature (main reason due to lockdown for a certain period in the whole world )
  
  
- The dataset reflects the complexity of decision making during routine clinical care, as opposed to what happens in a more controlled research setting, and data sparsity is, therefore, expected.
- The other dataset is taken and to allow users to compare the spread of covid-19 in more than two countries at one go in both graphical as well as tabular way.

DataSet selection :

  1. Dataset decided which has anonymized data from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein,at São Paulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and additional laboratory tests during a visit to the hospital.<source : Kaggle>
  2. Population data is taken from WHO website.
  3. Dataset of coronavirus cases is taken from github
