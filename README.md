R-shiny Dashboard


The World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, as a pandemic on March 11, while the exponential increase in the number of cases was risking to overwhelm health systems around the world.
It has affected many spectrum :
  1. Health
  2. Daily life as Job and Business
  3. Global temperature (main reason due to lockdown for a certain period in the whole world )
  
1. The dataset reflects the complexity of decision making during routine clinical care, as opposed to what happens in a more controlled research setting, and data sparsity is, therefore, expected.
2. The other dataset is taken and to allow users to compare the spread of covid-19 in more than two countries at one go in both graphical as well as tabular way.
3. The data visualization methods employed on laboratory test data to make it easier for multidisciplinary teams to collaborate around COVID-19 real-world data.

DataSet selection :

  1. Dataset decided which has anonymized data from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein,at SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and additional laboratory tests during a visit to the hospital.<source : Kaggle>
  2. Population data is taken from WHO website.
  3. Dataset of coronavirus cases is taken from github
